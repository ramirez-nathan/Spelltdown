## Overview
Spelltdown is a VR-based game that sees players draw runes using the controllers (tested using Meta Quest 2). You play as a spellcaster apprentice trying to learn wizardry, but you "accidentally" press a button you're not supposed to press. The magic reactor becomes unable and starts emitting runes. In order to fix the mess you created, you have to trace every rune that appears with your wand. If you take too long, the reactor melts down, and you lose your apprenticeship. Try to keep the magic reactor as stable as possible!

## Game Features
- VR implementation
- Gesture recognition with MiVRy plugin
- Built using Unity 6.0 (6000.0.062f1)

## Technical Challenges
- Setting up the Meta SDK and XR environment, which took up a majority of the time
- Getting limited by the free trial of MiVRy, since we could only include 100 "gestures" in our project
- Unity compilation/build time, which severely slowed down testing progress
- Uploading our game to the Meta Quest 2 was difficult, since our cables couldn't transmit data quickly

## Future Improvements
- Add compatiblity with other VR headsets (including the Meta Quest 3)
- Add different types of runes for more game variety
- Implement more custom assets
- Allow for more gesture recognition
- Make low-poly artstyle more consistent
- Implement custom music and more sounds
