## Overview
Spelltdown is a VR-based game that sees players draw runes using the controllers (tested using Meta Quest 2). You play as a spellcaster apprentice trying to learn wizardry, but you "accidentally" press a button you're not supposed to press. The magic reactor becomes unable and starts emitting runes. In order to fix the mess you created, you have to trace every rune that appears with your wand. If you take too long, the reactor melts down, and you lose your apprenticeship. Try to keep the magic reactor as stable as possible!
